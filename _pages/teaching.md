My interest in teaching developed during the 12 years I spent educating school students prior to my PhD studies, which I pursued as a part-time hobby. This formative period fueled my passion for education and honed my ability to explain complex topics in a clear and engaging manner.

Although there was a brief interlude where I did not engage in teaching, I am currently supervising three PhD students. Previously, I have successfully guided two PhD students and one Masterâ€™s student through their research journeys. These experiences underscore my commitment to nurturing the next generation of scholars in our field.

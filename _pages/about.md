I am an experienced, high-energy physicist with a PhD in experimental particle physics. My research focuses on the Higgs properties, vector boson scattering and the measurement of anomalous gauge coupling in the electroweak symmetry-breaking sector of the standard model. I have extensive experience with the development and R&D of a gaseous electron multiplier (GEM) detector for the compact muon solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC.

Currently, I am working on the measurement of anomalous triple gauge couplings using the VV semi-leptonic channel, the search for high mass scalar Higgs like particle that decays to ZZ to 2l2Q, and the search for resonant particles that decay to HH->WWgg, using both semi-leptonic and fully hadronic decay channels of WW. I am also involved in the High mass Higgs search using the ZZ decay channel.

Earlier, I worked on the Higgs differential and fiducial cross-section measurement and its interpretation with kb, kc and kLambda studies, vector boson scattering studies and double Higgs search in the WWgg channel. Furthermore, I was the convener of CMS HLT-EGamma POG. I maintained and upgraded CPPF hardware and emulator comparison deployed at Level-1 at the CMS detector.

<b>Summary</b> : I am a dedicated researcher who loves teaching, research and outreach activities. I enjoy coding and scripting and have experience with C/C++, Python, Tensorflow, shell script, and HTML.</p>

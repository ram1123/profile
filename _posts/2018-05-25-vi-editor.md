# Introduction

`vi` (short for **"visual editor"**) is a text editor that is widely used in Unix-like operating systems. It is a terminal-based editor, which means it can be used from a command-line interface. `vi` is known for its mode-based interface and for being able to perform advanced text editing tasks efficiently.

There are two main modes in `vi`:

- `Command mode`: The mode you start in when you first open a file in `vi`. In this mode, you can execute commands to perform actions such as saving changes, quitting the editor, or moving the cursor.
- `Insert mode`: The mode you enter when you want to insert text into a file. In this mode, you can type text normally, as if you were using a word processor.

To switch from Command mode to Insert mode, you can press the `i` key. To switch back to Command mode, you can press the `Esc` key.

Here are some basic commands you can use in `vi`:

- `i`: Enter Insert mode.
- `Esc`: Return to Command mode.
- `:w`: Save changes to the file.
- `:q`: Quit `vi` without saving changes.
- `:wq`: Save changes and quit `vi`.
- `:x`: Save changes and quit `vi` (same as `:wq`).
- `dd`: Delete the current line.
- `x`: Delete the character under the cursor.
- `u`: Undo the last change.
- `/pattern`: Search for the `pattern` in the file.

***Note that the commands in `vi` must be entered in Command mode***

# Commands that I used
## Auto-complete the words

```
CTRL + p
```

## Substitute with ascending numbers:

* Suppose we want to replace each occurrence of "`abc`" with "`xyz_N`" where N is an ascending number (xyz_1, xyz_2, xyz_3, and so on). One approach uses the following command:

    ```bash
    :let i=1 | g/abc/s//\='xyz_'.i/ | let i=i+1
    ```

* This will replace only first occurrence of each line. There is also command that can replace all, for it look at link below.

## Comment all lines contaning a pattern:

```bash
        :%s/.*pattern/#&
```

This command adds `#` to the begining of each line contaning `pattern`.

## To insert a file immediately after the line containing the cursor:

   ```bash
   :r examples.txt
   ```

This inserts the contents of the file examples.txt immediately after the current line.

## To insert the contents of another file after a specific line in the current file:

```bash
    23:r toc.txt
```

This inserts the contents of the file "toc.txt" after line 23 of the current file. Line 24 is empty; the contents of the inserted file begin at line 25.

## search a keyword

press Esc key to go to command mode, then type

```bash
    /keyword
```

then press enter. And use key "n" to search next and use "shift/Caps Lock button" to search in reverse direction

## Search and replace:
go in command mode by pressing Esc key, then type

```bash
    :%s/wordToBeReplaced/NewWord/gc
```
then press enter. Then if you want to change the highlighted word then use "y" else use "n" to go to next word.

### Several different options for search and replace

1. `:s/foo/bar/g`

    Change each 'foo' to 'bar' in the current line.

2. `:%s/foo/bar/g`

    Change each 'foo' to 'bar' in all the lines.

3. `:5,12s/foo/bar/g`

    Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines from line 5 to line 12 (inclusive).

4. `:'a,'bs/foo/bar/g`

    Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines from mark a to mark b inclusive.

5. `:'<,'>s/foo/bar/g`

    When compiled with, +visual change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines within a visual selection. Vim automatically appends the visual selection range ('<,'>) for any ex command when you select an area and enter

6. `:.,$s/foo/bar/g`

    Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines from the current line (.) to the last line ($) inclusive.

7. `:.,+2s/foo/bar/g`

    Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for the current line (.) and the two next lines (+2).

8. `:g/^baz/s/foo/bar/g`

    Change each 'foo' to 'bar' in each line starting with 'baz'.

## Inserting text in multiple lines (Visual Selection)

- Press Ctrl+V

- Extend the visual block using jj or arrow

- Press $ for the end of line press ^ for beginning of line.

- Press A or Shift+i for insert mode

- Then type anything that you want

- Then press ESC.

Ref: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Inserting_text_in_multiple_lines

## Search and Replace using Visual Selection

- Press Ctrl+V

- Extend the visual block using jj or arrow

- when text is selected visually, press : to enter the command (when you press : then :'<,'> will automatically come)

- example of the command:

```bash
s/red/green/g
```
Ref: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace_in_a_visual_selection

## Mark Option in Vi:

**mx**  => mark the current line with letter x (where x is from a to z or A to Z)

**'x**  => Find line marked with letter x

Usual commands like d, y, etc also work with mark option.

For detail look at ref: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_marks

## Delete some characters from the end of many lines:

To delete 6 characters from the end of all line, use command:

```bash
       :%s/.\{6}$//
```

## To list the line numbers from present line to end
```bash
       :%s/.\{1}$/\=printf('%-4d', line('.'))
```

## How to use Recorder?
An example to replace string **OldString** with **NewString** contained in multiple *.cpp files:

- vim *.cpp

- qx            # start recording to register x

- :%s/OldString/NewString/g

- :wnext

- q             # stop recording

- @x            # playback to see if it works correctly

- 999@x         # repeat 999 times to complete the job

-> tutorial on record: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/01/vi-and-vim-macro-tutorial-how-to-record-and-play/

## How to edit record:

Assume that we are using register `a` for recording a task.

You can use "ap which will insert the text in the buffer (where a is your register):

```bash
        iThis is A<1b>
```

Now I can just change the line to maybe:

    ```bash
        iThis is an edited macro<1b>
    ```

Then I do `^v$"ay` to yank (copy) this line to the a register:

```
        ^ for start of line
        v for visual mode
        $ for end of line
        "ay yank the selection to register a
```

## Efficient way to remove multiple spaces between two words

**ciw** and then escape back to normal mode.

## duplicate lines matching a pattern, and modify the second line, all in one command

**TASK**: Search all lines containing "atributeA", like this one

```
this.attributeA=attributeA //basic constructor
```

should turn into

```
this.attributeA=attributeA //basic constructor
this.attributeB=attributeB //basic constructor
```

**Soulution**

```
:g/attributeA/ copy . | s//attributeB/g
```

where

```
:g/pattern/ command1 | command2 | ...
```

executes commands on each line matching `pattern` (see `:help :global`).

Here,

```
copy .
```

copies the current line (see `:help :copy`) matched by `:g` to after the address `.`` (meaning the current line), and

```
s/pattern/replacement/g
```

then performs a substitution on the current line (see `:help :substitute`), i.e. the copy you just made. The `g` flag at the end causes the substitution to be performed for all matching patterns in the line, not just the first. Also note that I left the search pattern empty: Vim will remember the last search pattern used in the previous `:global` or `:substitute` command as a convenience.

Substitute with ascending numbers:
=> Suppose we want to replace each occurrence of "abc" with "xyz_N" where N is an ascending number (xyz_1, xyz_2, xyz_3, and so on). One approach uses the following command:

:let i=1 | g/abc/s//\='xyz_'.i/ | let i=i+1

This will replace the only first occurrence of each line. There is also command that can replace all, for it looks at the link below.

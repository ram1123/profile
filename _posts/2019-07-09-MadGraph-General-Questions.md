# Some questions

## CMS perspective only

1. Why do we need reweight card?

2. Does only customized card work?

## General Questions

1. What is the meaning of `[QCD]` syntax?

   ```
   This adds one additional jet in the channel.
   ```

1. What is the meaning of `[noborn=QCD]` syntax?

   ```
   Generally, all relevant matrix elements has three kind of diagrams. They are born (tree level diagrams), virtual and real-emission.

   One can use the different kind of syntax depending on the use. If we would like to ignore the tree level diagrams then we should use the syntax of [noborn=QCD].

   Other possibilities are [real=QCD] or [loop=QCD] to exclude the virtual diagrams.
   ```

2. What is the meaning of the order QED/QCD?

   ```
   By default madgraph takes lowest order of QED and highest order of QCD.
   ```

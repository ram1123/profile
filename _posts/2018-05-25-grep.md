# Introduction

The `grep` command is a powerful utility for searching for strings or patterns in text files. It stands for "global regular expression print" and is commonly used to search for specific patterns of text within a file or a set of files.

Here is the general syntax for the `grep` command:

```bash
grep [options] PATTERN [FILE...]
```

- `options`: Optional flags that modify the behavior of the `grep` command. Some common options include `-i` for case-insensitive matching, `-v` for inverting the match, and `-r` for searching recursively in a directory.
- `PATTERN`: The pattern or string to be searched for.
- `FILE...`: The input file or files to be searched. If no file is specified, `grep` will read from the standard input stream.

For example, the following command will search for the word "apple" in the file fruits.txt:

```bash
grep "apple" fruits.txt
```

# Grep or, and and not

- grep or condition using `\|`

  - `grep 'pattern1\|pattern2' filename`

- Grep OR Using `-E`

  - `grep -E 'pattern1|pattern2' filename`

- Grep OR Using `egrep`

  - `egrep 'pattern1|pattern2' filename`

- Grep OR Using grep `-e`

  - `grep -e pattern1 -e pattern2 filename`

- Grep AND using -E `pattern1.*pattern2`

  - `grep -E 'pattern1.*pattern2' filename`
  - `grep -E 'pattern1.*pattern2|pattern2.*pattern1' filename`

- Grep AND using Multiple grep command

  - `grep -E 'pattern1' filename | grep -E 'pattern2'`

- Grep NOT using grep -v (This will print each line that does not contain the pattern.)

  - `grep -v 'pattern1' filename`

- Print only file names that does not contain pattern (`-L`)

  - `grep -L 'pattern' filename`

- Include/Exclude a particular file format from grep search [^1]:
  - `grep pattern -r --include=\*.{cpp,h} rootdir`
  - `grep pattern -r --exclude=\*.{cpp,h} rootdir`
  - To exclude directory use: `--exclude-dir={abc,def}`

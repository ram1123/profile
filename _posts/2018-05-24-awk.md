AWK is one of mostly used text-processing utilities on Linux. It takes its name from initials of its authors - `Aho, Wienberger and Kernighan`. It is a scripting language that processes data files, especially text files that are organized in rows and columns.

AWK is used for stream processing, where the basic unit is the string. **It considers a text file as a collection of fields and records. Each row is a record, and a record is a collection of fields.** The syntax of AWK is as follows:

```bash
awk [options] 'patter {action}' input_file
```

As an AWK script:

```bash
awk [options] script_name input_file
```

The most commonly used command-line options of awk are "`-F`" and `-f`:

```
-F : to change input field seperator
-f : to name script file
```

There are two types of buffers used in AWK - the record buffer and field buffer.

The field buffer is denoted as $1, $2... $n, where 'n' indicates the field number in the input file. So, $2 indicates the second field (or the second column in a file).

The record buffer is denoted as $0, which indicates the whole record.

**Example**

fileName : file1.txt

```
ram    1 get       7
shyam   2 put      8
krishna  3 lost    9
sharma   4 found   8
archana  5 good    7
kumari   6 best    6
```

To print third and first field in a file, use the command

```bash
awk '{print $3, $1}' file1.txt
```

Output:

```
get ram
put shyam
lost krishna
found sharma
good archana
best kumari
```

## AWK process flow

AWK scripts are divided into the following three parts - **BEGIN (pre-processing), body (processing) and END (post-processing)**.

**BEGIN** is the part of the AWK script where variables can be initialised and report headings can be created. The processing body contains the data that needs to be processed, like a loop. **END** or the post-processing part analyses or prints the data that has been processed.

```bash
awk 'BEGIN {print "Sum \t average"} {tot=$2+$4; avg=tot/3; print tot,avg} END {print "======================\nProcessing End...\n================="}' file1.txt
```

Output:

```
Sum    average
8  2.66667
10  3.33333
12  4
12  4
12  4
12  4
======================
Processing End...
=================
```

## skip blank lines

There are two approaches you can try to filter out lines:

```bash
awk 'NF' data.txt
```

and

```bash
awk 'length' data.txt
```

Just put these at the start of your command, i.e.,

```bash
awk -v variable=$bashvariable 'NF { print variable ... }' myinfile
```

or

```bash
awk -v variable=$bashvariable 'length { print variable  ... }' myinfile
```

Both of these act as gatekeepers/if-statements.

The first approach works by only printing out lines where the number of fields (NF) is not zero (i.e., greater than zero).

The second method looks at the line length and acts if the length is not zero (i.e., greater than zero)

You can pick the approach that is most suitable for your data/needs.

## If Else

Reference: https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/02/awk-conditional-statements

```bash
awk '{if ($3 < 105 && $3>65) print $3}' mass.txt
```

## Generate random number

```bash
awk -v min=5 -v max=10 'BEGIN{srand(); print int(min+rand()*(max-min+1))}'
```

## For loop

**Command 1**

```bash
awk -F'[, ]' '{for(i=2;i<=NF;i++){print $1,$i}}' file
```

**Command 2**

```bash
awk 'BEGIN { for (i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) print i }'
```

If you want to print awk output in the same line add `| xargs | sed -e 's/ /,/g'` as shown below:

```bash
awk 'BEGIN { for (i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) print i }' | xargs | sed -e 's/ /, /g'
```

This will print each value seperated by "comma and a space" in same line.

# select row and element in awk

# replace a particular row and column value of one file with another

Reference: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26089692/replace-a-particular-row-and-column-value-of-one-file-with-another](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26089692/replace-a-particular-row-and-column-value-of-one-file-with-another)

# Count number of character of each line

```bash
awk '{print length}' filename.txt
```

This command prints length of each line. Here `length` is equivalent to `length($0)`, where `$0` denotes the current line[^1length].

A gitlab workflow for analysis is given in this blog. This is a general git workflow, summarised in terms of CMS-AN.

# Summary of Workflow

1. Fork the repository under your gitlab account.
2. Clone the repository using your username and setup as per the instruction given in Section-[Gitlab AN setup](#gitlab-anpaper-clone-steps)
3. Checkout new branch (`git checkout -b <BranchName>`) and start working. You can commit frequently and save changes.
4. When you are ready with all your changes and think it should be merged in the central repository. Then do the following:

   - First update your local from `master` branch of our central repository.

   - Then commit your changs and make the **merge request** to our central repository.

5. Done.

# Detailed workflow

 <!-- ![Event having Higgs]({{ site.url }}/assets/event_pic/HIG-19-003_v5.png){:height="560px" width="900px"} -->

1. Fork the repository from the central repository: [https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/AN-20-165](https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/AN-20-165)

   - Click on `Fork`, as shown in image below:

     ![]({{ site.url }}/assets/CMS_AN_GitLabWorkFlow/fork_1.png)

   - If you are attached with another organization then it may show you page as shown below then click on your name:

     > ![fork_2]({{ site.url }}/assets/CMS_AN_GitLabWorkFlow/fork_2.png)

2. Now, one can see the repository into your gitlab account: `https://gitlab.cern.ch/users/<LXPLUS-USER-NAME>/projects`. Then click on the project named **AN-20-165**.

3. Then copy the SSH link (we need this in **step-5(c)**).

   a.

   > ![ssh_link_1]({{ site.url }}/assets/CMS_AN_GitLabWorkFlow/ssh_link_1.png)

   b.

   > ![ssh_link_2]({{ site.url }}/assets/CMS_AN_GitLabWorkFlow/ssh_link_2.png)

4. Clone the repository using the **central repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git
   ```

5. Next, we need to add remote which will point to our personal repository.

   a) What is "**remote**" in the above command?

   When we collaborate on a git project, where many people are working then we might need to get updates from other people repository. So, we need to know the address (or the pointer of the address) to the other repository. The pointer of the repository address is known as remote. Now, there are couple of things that we should know.

   b) **How to check the remotes?**

   If you already cloned the repository (say [https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/AN-20-165](https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/AN-20-165)) then you can check the remote name using:

   ```bash
   cd AN-20-165
   git remote -v
   ```

   Its output should be like this:

   ```bash
   [rasharma@lxplus734 AN-20-165]$ git remote -v
    origin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git (fetch)
    origin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git (push)
   ```

   Here, the name of your remote is "origin".
   If you clone from your personal repository, (say [ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/rasharma/AN-20-165.git](ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/rasharma/AN-20-165.git)), then the origin will point to your repository (**Added this line for information but don't clone from personal repository, else you won't get the utils directory by default. It is because of some permission issue.**).

   ```bash
   [rasharma@lxplus734 AN-20-165]$ git remote -v
    origin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/rasharma/AN-20-165.git (fetch)
    origin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/rasharma/AN-20-165.git (push)
   ```

   c) **How to add new remotes?**
   If you cloned from the central repository, then you should add your repository remote. To add your remote:

   ```bash
   cd AN-20-165
   git remote add <ChooseAnyName> ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git
   ```

   I am choosing name "myRepo".

   ```bash
   cd AN-20-165
   git remote add myRepo ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/rasharma/AN-20-165.git
   ```

   Just to confirm if the remote is added or not, please check again the remote usign the command:

   ```bash
   cd AN-20-165
   git remote -v
   ```

   Its output should be like this:

   ```bash
   [rasharma@lxplus734 AN-20-165]$ git remote -v
    myRepo  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/rasharma/AN-20-165.git (fetch)
    myRepo  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/rasharma/AN-20-165.git (push)
    origin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git (fetch)
    origin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git (push)
   ```

   Now you can see that there are two names **myRepo** and **origin**. Both of them are attached to the ssh link. One belongs to my github username and another belongs to our central repository.

   Once you added your remote you should always use your repository remote name for adding your commits.

   **NOTE:** You should keep both remotes with you (central and yours). Your repository remote for committing your changes and central repository remote to update your local branch with the latest updates added by other people.

6. Branch Creating:

   ```bash
   cd AN-20-165
   git checkout -b <NewBranchName>
   ```

   For example I created a branch named **Doc_GitUses**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b Doc_GitUses
   ```

7. Check if the branch created using command:

   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

   Output should look like:

   ```bash
   [username@lxplus734 AN-20-165]$ git branch
    * Doc_GitUses
    master
   ```

   Here, "\*" shows that the current banch on which you are is **Doc_GitUses**.

8. If you want to change the branch to master then do
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```
   One should not work on master branch so don't edit here. Go back to the branch you created using `git checkout NewBranchName`, then edit on **NewBranchName**.
9. You can commit and push as many times as you want. When you think you are done then you should try to see if anyone else already update anything in master or not. For this you should try to pull the updates from master.

   ```bash
   git pull <remote-name> master
   ```

   **NOTE: Our main repository remote name is "origin".** So, the command that we should use is

   ```bash
   git pull origin master
   ```

10. When you run the command: `git pull origin master` then it will pull the latest changes from master to your local (into your current branch).

- Here you might get the merge conflict. This comes when two people are editing the same file. Then git is unable to decide what to choose.

- Now, we should open the file having conflicts then resolve it.

- If you don't know about it please look at this link: [Resolving a merge conflict using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)

- If you have still an issue then please let me know.

11. If the `git pull` works without any error or warning then commit and push your changes:

```bash
git commit
```

Then this will open the editor, where you can write a summary message of your commit then close the file.

```bash
git push <remote-name> <NewBranchName>
```

In the previous steps, I took personal repository remote name as `myRepo` and NewBranchName as `Doc_GitUses`. So, one should use the command:

```bash
git push myRepo Doc_GitUses
```

12. If you think you are ready for making merge request. Then before making merge request always update your local branch from master branch of the central repository. If the central repository given by **origin** :

```bash
[rasharma@lxplus734 AN-20-165]$ git remote -v
   myRepo  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/rasharma/AN-20-165.git (fetch)
   myRepo  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/rasharma/AN-20-165.git (push)
   origin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git (fetch)
   origin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git (push)
```

Then, you should update your local branch using command:

```bash
git pull <remote-name> master
```

In the example, that we showed above our central remote name is **origin** so we should run the command:
Then, you should update your local branch using command:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

13. Finally, make the merge request from the gitlab webpage as shown below:

- Step-1:
  > ![merge_1]({{ site.url }}/assets/CMS_AN_GitLabWorkFlow/merge_1.png)
- Step-2: **Here, remember to fill out "Assignee" as @atishelm**

  > ![merge_2]({{ site.url }}/assets/CMS_AN_GitLabWorkFlow/merge_2.png)

# Commands Summary

```bash
git clone --recursive ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git  # if you are working on lxplus you should use ssh link
cd AN-20-165
git remote add myRepo ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/<YourUserName>/AN-20-165.git
# Next step create a branch name with the doc \you want to add (say you want to update systematics)
git checkout -b Doc_Systematics
# Edit files
git add a.tex b.tex # add all the files that you modified
git commit # this opens up the editor add your update summary and close this  file.
git pull origin master # Grab the latest updates from master branch
# you might see some conflict if you and some other people edited the same branch. If yes, then you need to remove conflict and then commit.
git push myRepo Doc_Systematics  # Here myRepo and Doc_Systematics are the names that you assigned above.
# Go to wepage of your github repo and make pull request.
```

# Some known issues & their fixes

1. **Always try to clone from central repository only. i.e. `ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git`.** There is a known issue of the permission of cloing the utils as submodule. If we clone from central repository then it automatically clones the utils repository. This does not work when we try to clone from our personal (forked) repository.

2. If your ssh key is not properly saved in the gitlab then you may get following error:

   > ![ssh_clone_issue]({{ site.url }}/assets/CMS_AN_GitLabWorkFlow/ssh_clone_issue.png)

   Generally, all of us work with both github and gitlab. So, we should keep the ssh key same at both places. The above error appears when the key is not matched at lxplus and at gitlab. To fix this issue try to copy the content of file `.ssh/id_rsa.pub` from your lxplus. Then add it in your gitlab account settings and save it. Then it should work.

# Gitlab AN/Paper clone steps

## Setup Commands

To clone on lxplus, first move to your desired working area on lxplus and clone the respository:

Via HTTPS:

    git clone --recursive https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git

Via SSH:

    git clone --recursive ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git

**Note:** If you clone via SSH, you will need to set your git user email address in order for your GitLab profile picture to show up on the GitLab.com remote repository next to your commits. This is recommended as it will make it easier to identify who makes commits. This is done in your cloned repository with the command:

    git config --local user.email "username@cern.ch"

where "username@cern.ch" should be your CERN e-mail address, as this should be associated with your GitLab account.

Via KRB5:

    git clone --recursive https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/tdr/notes/AN-20-165.git

Note the --recursive option, necessary for the linked "utils" commit to be cloned for the tdr executable.

After cloning you should change to the cloned repository directory:

    cd AN-20-165

Then run one of the following commands, depending on your shell. I used -sh for bash (Bourne-Again shell) on lxplus by default. This command needs to be run every time you start a new lxplus session:

    eval `utils/tdr runtime -sh` # bash
    eval `utils/tdr runtime -csh` # csh
    eval `utils/tdr runtime -fish` # fish

To produce the PDF, run the tdr executable:

    tdr --style=note b # the local document with the name of the directory is the default build target

if this works properly, at the end of the output you should see:

    PDF Output file: /tmp/<lxplusUsername>/tdr_bld_<randomHash>/AN-20-165_temp.pdf

this is the location of the LaTeX generater PDF of the analysis note. The output should also notify you of any LaTeX compilation errors.

## Other Commands

In case the utils submodule is removed from the repository, it can be added back locally and committed with the commands:

    git submodule add -b master ../../utils
    git add utils
    git commit -m "Adding the latest utils submodule"

it can also be updated to the latest available version via the commands:

    git submodule update --remote
    git add utils
    git commit -m "Updating to the latest utils commit"

# Introduction

I prepared a repository where I added a script that helps us to get easily the custom nanoAOD or the full cmssw detector simulation starting from the gridpack. The repository is available on GitHub: [CMS_FulllSimulation](https://github.com/ram1123/CMS_FulllSimulation)

# Getting Started with the Repository

To begin using the CMS Full Simulation tools, you'll need to clone the repository and navigate to the main directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ram1123/CMS_FulllSimulation.git -b main
cd CMS_FulllSimulation
```

# Key Components

The main script of the repository is `GetFullSimScriptsFromMCCM.py`, a Python script that automates the entire process from downloading the required scripts to submitting jobs via a Condor cluster. Here are the main tasks it performs:

1. **Downloading Scripts:** Automatically fetches scripts from specified URLs.
2. **Script Modification and Parsing:** Modifies scripts and extracts CMSSW version and configuration file information. The number of events and the logger frequency need to be updated by hand.
3. **Executable and JDL File Generation:** Creates executable scripts and Job Description Language (JDL) files for Condor job submission.
4. **Job Submission:** Submits the jobs using the generated JDL files.

The workflow relies on external files such as `ChainDownloadLinkFromMccM_dict.py` for managing download links and `gridpack_lists.py` for listing the gridpacks needed with path.

# Step-by-Step Simulation Process

The simulation process involves several steps, which are outlined in the repository's README file:

1. **Prepare Configuration Files:** Generate Python configuration files required for each stage of the simulation using CMSDriver commands.
2. **Modify Configuration:** Append a random number generator to the configuration to ensure unique event generation, number of events, logger frequency, gridpack path, etc.
3. **Run Scripts Sequentially:** Execute each script in the proper sequence to process events through multiple CMS data formats.

# Conclusion

This repository significantly simplifies the task of running full detector simulations for the CMS experiment.

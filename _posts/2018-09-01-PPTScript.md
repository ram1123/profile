------------------------------------

* Git clone the script

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ram1123/PPT_script.git
  ```

* Above command will create a directory named PPT_Script

* Put all of your plot file in this directory.

  - Please name the plots as you want the title of the slide, just put different words together by underscore(\_). Because the name of file will become the heading of slide replacing underscore (\_) by spaces.

* Now Run the command ./MakePPT.sh

* But by default the script will take only \*.pdf files only

* If you want to use any other format then use -f option of the script

  ```bash
  ./MakePPT.sh -f jpg
  #or
  ./MakePPT.sh -f jpeg
  ```

* Also by default it will make a pdf file named **ppt_test.pdf**

* If you want to get any other name then you can use -n option of the script

  ```bash
  ./MakePPT.sh -n ram
  ```

* Then it will create output pdf file with name **ram.pdf**

* If you want to do both things at a time, i.e. change the file format to recognize and name of output file then you can use both option like

  ```bash
  ./MakePPT.sh -f jpeg -n ram
  ```

* You May Get error if you don't have compiler pdflatex or other dependencies that is necessary for the beamer to make ppt.

* If you face any problem then you can post your problem on the link:[https://github.com/ram1123/PPT_script/issues](https://github.com/ram1123/PPT_script/issues). I will try to resolve the problem as soon as possible.

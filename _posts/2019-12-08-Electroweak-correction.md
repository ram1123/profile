# Electroweak correction

- Electroweak correction come in two variants: virtual corrections and real emission correction.

- Virtual electroweak corrections often studied in the context of gauge boson and jet production at large transverse momentum (EW-Sudakov suppression). Usually negative and increasing with $p_T$.

- Real electroweak corrections usually constitute a separate process. However, largest BR of W/Z bosons is hadronic, thus (almost) indistinguishable in jet production. Nonetheless may constitute signal in itself.

- When large scale differences occur resummation is needed in either case.

# Introduction

The `find` command is a powerful command-line utility that is used to search for files and directories in a specified location. It can be used to perform operations such as searching for files with specific names, searching for files with specific attributes, and executing commands on the found files.

Here is the general syntax for the `find` command:

```bash
find [path...] [expression]
```

- `path...`: The starting point for the search. The search will start from each directory specified in `path...`. If no `path...` is specified, the current directory is used as the starting point.
- `expression`: An expression that specifies the conditions that the files must match to be selected. The expression can include options, tests, and actions.

For example, the following command will find all files in the current directory and its subdirectories with a `.txt` extension:

```bash
find . -name "*.txt"
```

# General commands that I used

- Find all files larger than 500 MB [ Ref. ]

    ```bash
    find / -type f -size +500M
    ```

- Find all files smaller than 500 MB

    ```bash
    find / -type f -size -500M
    ```

- Find all files larger than 30 MB and delete it.

    ```bash
    find . -type f -size +30M -exec rm {} \;
    ```

- To ask for each file before delete:

    ```bash
    find . -type f -size +30M -exec rm -i {} \;
    ```

- To find all \*.tar.gz file and delete it

    ```bash
    find . -type f -name "*.tar.gz" -size +30M -exec rm -i {} \;
    ```

- To find all \*.tar.gz file and move it

    ```bash
    find . -type f -name "*.tar.gz" -size +30M -exec mv {} NewFolder/ \;
    ```
